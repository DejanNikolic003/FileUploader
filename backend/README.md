This is the backend repository for FileUploader, built with Express, Prisma, and MySQL. It serves as the API layer for handling user authentication, file uploads, folder management, and other core functionalities. Prisma ORM is used for type-safe and efficient database interactions with a MySQL database. The backend is structured with RESTful routes and includes middleware for security and request validation. It supports JWT-based authentication and integrates seamlessly with the React frontend.
